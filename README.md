# Building a WASM sqlite with an embedded extension

I wanted to build a wasm version of sqlite, but I also wanted to include [an
extension](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/main/docs/stats.md) in it.

As far as I know, you can't dynamically load extensions into the wasm version
of sqlite, so I wanted to build a version that had it statically linked in.

As I don't know C very well, this seemed pretty hopeless - but thankfully I
found [sqlite-lines](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-lines/) by @asg017 (who
also kindly [helped me on
twitter](https://twitter.com/agarcia_me/status/1565775569664430080)), which
[demonstrated](https://observablehq.com/@asg017/introducing-sqlite-lines) that
it was possible.

## The pieces

To build it, I followed in Alex's footsteps and used these pieces:

- [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/)
- The [sqlite amalgamation file](https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html) and
  [extension header
  file](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/master/src/sqlite3ext.h)
  - I just copied the versions Alex used
- The [stats
  file](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/main/src/sqlite3-stats.c) from
  sqlean
- The [sqlite wasm API](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/) from sql.js
- The [Makefile](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-lines/blob/main/Makefile) and
  [core-init.c](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-lines/blob/main/core_init.c)
  file from [sqlite-lines](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-lines)

## The idea

The basic idea of building a sqlite that has an extension statically linked is
that you can use an undocumented C preprocessor macro called
`SQLITE_EXTRA_INIT` which will, if defined, load extra code into sqlite after
finishing up its own initialization. If you point `SQLITE_EXTRA_INIT` at a
function that calls
[`sqlite3_auto_extension`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/auto_extension.html)
with a pointer to your extension's init function, it will load right after
sqlite loads itself and the functions defined within will be available to
sqlite.

## The steps

To make the idea happen, this code:

- sets `SQLITE_EXTRA_INIT` [here](https://github.com/llimllib/wasm_sqlite_with_stats/blob/83bdf9e1bf6808590a281d8f2d32cafafa750b33/Makefile#L13), pointing to the `core_init` function
- defines the `core_init` function [here](https://github.com/llimllib/wasm_sqlite_with_stats/blob/83bdf9e1bf6808590a281d8f2d32cafafa750b33/core_init.c)
- makes `core_init` available to sqlite by [appending it](https://github.com/llimllib/wasm_sqlite_with_stats/blob/83bdf9e1bf6808590a281d8f2d32cafafa750b33/Makefile#L52) to the end of the amalgamation file as the first step of our build process
- uses emscripten [to build](https://github.com/llimllib/wasm_sqlite_with_stats/blob/83bdf9e1bf6808590a281d8f2d32cafafa750b33/Makefile#L38) sqlite3-stats.c and the amalgamation file (with the appended `SQLITE_EXTRA_INIT` bit) together into a wasm output

Finally, I made an [HTML page](https://github.com/llimllib/wasm_sqlite_with_stats/blob/e057459ef636de80091bbc781751055b9bf5395d/index.html) that makes the most basic possible use of the sqlite binary to make sure that the stats extension has been loaded.

## Build it yourself

`make clean wasm`

- user note: run the html file from the 'dist' directory, not the root
  directory, or it won't find the wasm file

## Future ideas

- It would be cool to have this version of sqlite running [sqlite fiddle](https://sqlite.org/fiddle/)
    - [source code for fiddle](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/tree/master/ext/wasm)
    - [notes on how to build that](https://notes.billmill.org/databases/sqlite/building_sqlite_wasm.html)
- I think maybe it would be possible to not use sql.js and instead use [the sqlite javascript API referenced here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31520851)
    - this API exists [here](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/tree/ad617b4d6d508486a04b17bf6ac315b1b20aa94f/ext/wasm/api), not sure whether/how I could use it
